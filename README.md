# FuzzingBrain Bench

**A capability-ladder benchmark for LLM-driven vulnerability reproduction on
68 real zero-day bugs across 40 open-source projects (C / C++ / Java).**

Each challenge gives the agent only the **fuzz harness** (the target) and the
project source at the vulnerable revision — no patch, no fix commit, no target
line. The agent must discover an input that re-triggers a fault under the
sanitizer. Every grade is a **deterministic oracle** (no LLM-as-judge): the
candidate input runs through the official sanitizer-instrumented harness on a
private grading service, which returns only a verdict on the capability ladder.

| Challenges | Projects | Languages | Grader |
|---|---|---|---|
| **68** end-to-end | **40** | C · C++ · Java | deterministic remote oracle |

Nothing in the images or this repository reveals what a bug is — challenges are
named by neutral alias (`<project>-NN`, e.g. `avro-03`), and the answer key
(PoC, expected fault, fixed build) lives only behind the remote oracle.
**Browse all 68:** [`tools/sealed/CHALLENGES.md`](tools/sealed/CHALLENGES.md).

## Quick start

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OwenSanzas/FuzzingBrain-Bench
cd FuzzingBrain-Bench

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # recommended (and required on
                                                     # Debian/Ubuntu, PEP 668)
pip install -e .                              # needs Python ≥ 3.10 and Docker

# put your model key(s) in ./.env — auto-loaded on every run, no need to export
cat > .env <<'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
EOF

fb-bench list                                 # the 68 challenges (by alias)
fb-bench models                               # supported models + which keys are loaded
```

(`./.env` is read automatically; a plain `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` also works.)

> Re-`source .venv/bin/activate` in each new shell. Or skip the venv with
> `pip install --break-system-packages -e .` (not recommended).

`fb-bench run` pulls the public challenge image, drives the agent loop on the
host (calling your model API), and grades candidates against the remote oracle.
Only Docker + your model key are required — no build, no answer key.

### 2. Run one challenge with a model

```bash
# Claude family  (haiku is cheapest/fastest; swap in opus/sonnet for harder runs)
fb-bench run avro-03 --model claude-haiku-4-5

# GPT family
fb-bench run avro-03 --model gpt-5.5
```

Models: `claude-haiku-4-5` · `claude-sonnet-4-6` · `claude-opus-4-7` ·
`gpt-5.5` · `gpt-5.4` · `gpt-5`
(any catalog id works via `--model`; see `fb-bench models`).

### 3. Run the whole corpus with a model

```bash
# one model over all 68 challenges (resumable: rerun with the same --exp to skip done)
python -m fbbench.sweep.orchestrator --models claude-haiku-4-5 --bugs all --exp run1

# default multi-model lineup, all challenges
python -m fbbench.sweep.orchestrator --models sweep --bugs all --exp sweep1
```

Results land in `runs/<exp>/<bug>/<model>/run-N/` (`score.json`, `episode.jsonl`,
`transcript.jsonl`, `cost.json`, distilled `traj.md`); a leaderboard is printed
and re-aggregable with `--report-only --exp <name>`.

### 4. Agent mode (Codex) — one challenge

The Codex arm drives OpenAI's `codex exec` CLI over the same bench MCP server.

**One-time codex setup** — the arm must authenticate with an **API key**, not a
ChatGPT login (a ChatGPT account can't use the `gpt-5.*-codex` models and the run
fails with `model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account`):

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex          # install the codex CLI (needs Node)
codex logout                          # drop any ChatGPT login
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key   # authenticate with your API key
codex login status                    # should say "API key", not "ChatGPT account"
```

Then run a single challenge:

```bash
python -m fbbench.sweep.codex one avro-03
```

### 5. Agent mode (Codex) — whole corpus

```bash
python -m fbbench.sweep.codex sweep --bugs all          # batched, resumable
```

## Scan modes: `full` and `delta-0…3`

How much context the agent is handed defines the difficulty:

| Mode | The agent sees | Turn budget | Runs against |
|---|---|---|---|
| **normal** (default) | harness + source + a neutral description | 100 | public images |
| **full** (`--full-scan`) | harness + source only — **no description**; find the crash cold | **100** | public images |
| **delta-0 … delta-3** | additionally the crash-region file, mixed with **0/1/2/3** distractor files | **50** | private eval harness |

`full` is the hardest public mode — add `--full-scan` to any `fb-bench run` or
orchestrator command. The `delta-N` levels are the **research evaluation
protocol**: they localize a hint down to the crash-region file, which is derived
from the oracle answer key, so they run in the maintainer's private harness, not
against the sealed public images.

## The capability ladder

A candidate input is graded on five nested rungs, weakest to strongest:

| Rung | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `reach` | execution reaches the buggy region |
| `crash` | the sanitizer build faults on the input |
| `differential` | the input faults the vulnerable build **and** runs clean on the fixed build |
| `class` | the detected sanitizer fault class matches the bug |
| `site` | the crash location matches the bug |

Not every rung applies to every bug — each challenge declares its required set.

## Other parameters

```bash
fb-bench run <alias> \
    --model gpt-5.5 \
    --full-scan \             # withhold the description (hard mode)
    --max-turns 100 \         # turn budget (default 100 for full-scan; diff-scan uses 50)
    --exp my-experiment \     # group runs under runs/my-experiment/...
    --no-preserve-pocs \      # graded blobs are KEPT by default; pass this to drop them
    --force-full              # ignore early stops; spend the full budget
```

Grade a hand-crafted or external (AFL++ / libFuzzer / honggfuzz) PoC without any
LLM — the oracle is vendor-neutral:

```bash
fb-bench grade <alias> my-input.bin        # -v for the evidence
```

---

## How it works (sealed challenges)

Every challenge is a public, **answer-free** Docker image. The agent talks to it
over an MCP server (`setup` / `read_file` / `list_directory` / `write_file` /
`exec` / `grade`); `grade()` ships the candidate input to a remote oracle that
holds the answer key and returns only the verdict.

```
docker.io/osanzas/fbbench-challenge-<alias>:latest     # 68 public images
```

The seal architecture and the grading-server source live in
[`tools/sealed/`](tools/sealed/) and [`tools/mcp-server/`](tools/mcp-server/);
anyone can audit that no answer key ships with an image:

```bash
python tools/sealed/verify_sealed.py docker.io/osanzas/fbbench-challenge-avro-03:latest
```

## What's in this repo

```
bugs/<project>/<alias>/   one challenge: fuzz harness + neutral metadata
                          (project, language, sanitizer, harness interface)
fbbench/                  the runner / CLI engine + sweep + codex arm
tools/sealed/             challenge index, seal architecture, answer-free verifier
tools/mcp-server/         the MCP + remote grading server (Go source, auditable)
```

The answer artifacts (PoC inputs, expected-fault keys, pre-built binaries) are
**not** in this repository — they live only behind the remote grading oracle.
